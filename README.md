# Foundry Combat Focus

FoundryVTT-addon that shows the chat and the combat tracker at the same time. The point is to reduce the amount of 
switching players need to do between the combat tracker (to see who's turn it is) and the chat (to see the results 
of their and other peoples' actions).  

Can be enabled / disabled in the module settings by every player (might not work great on small screens).
